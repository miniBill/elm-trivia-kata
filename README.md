# "Trivia" kata

This is a refactoring kata (exercise). The idea is to start from some code which is far from ideal (in this case, because it's a direct translation of spaghetti imperative code) and make it more readable, more robust, more idiomatic.

The original implementation is in [caradojo/trivia](https://github.com/caradojo/trivia).

I suggest starting by adding `elm-review`.

## Solution

There isn't a single "correct" solution, but you can look at my take in the `clean` branch.
